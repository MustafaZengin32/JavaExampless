1. What is a constructor in Java?

A constructor is a special method in a Java class that is called when an object of that class is created.
It initializes the properties of the object and performs other tasks necessary during object creation.

2. What types of constructors are there in Java?

In Java, there are two main types of constructors:
Default Constructor: When you do not define a constructor in your class,
a default constructor with no parameters is automatically created.
Parameterized Constructor: You can create custom constructors to initialize objects with specific values.

3. How does a constructor differ from a regular method?

Constructors have the same name as the class itself, whereas methods can have different names.
Constructors are automatically called when an object is created, while methods must be explicitly called.
Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.

5. Can you have multiple constructors in a class?

Yes, you can have multiple constructors in a class as long as they differ in the number or type of parameters.
This is known as constructor overloading.

7. What is a parameterized constructor?

A parameterized constructor is a custom constructor that accepts parameters to set object properties during initialization.

9. What is the purpose of a default constructor in Java?

The default constructor is used to create an object and
initialize its properties with default values when no custom constructor is present.
