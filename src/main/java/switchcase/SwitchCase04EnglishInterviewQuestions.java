Question 1: What is the purpose of the switch statement in Java?

Answer:It helps to make the code more organized and execute different actions based on different values.

Question 2: Which data types are allowed for the expression in a switch statement?

Answer: In Java, for the expression in a switch statement, the primitive data types byte, short, char, int are allowed,
as well as the enum data type, and  the String data type is also allowed.

Question 3: Why is break often used in a switch statement?

Answer: The break statement is used in a switch statement to terminate the branching process and exit the switch block.

Question 4: What happens if no break is used in a case block?

Answer: If no break is used in a case block, the execution continues,
and all subsequent case blocks will also be executed, regardless of whether their conditions are met or not.
This is referred to as "fallthrough."

Question 5: Can switch statements be used in nested forms?

Answer: Yes, switch statements can be nested, meaning a case block can be placed inside another case block.
However, this can negatively impact code readability and should be avoided when possible.

Question 6: What happens if no case matches the current value in the switch block?

Answer: If no matching case block is found for the current value,
the code in the optional default block will be executed,
if one exists. Otherwise, the switch block will simply be skipped.
