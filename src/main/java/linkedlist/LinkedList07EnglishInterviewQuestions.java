Question 1: What is a LinkedList in Java?

Answer: A LinkedList in Java is a data structure that consists of an ordered list of elements represented as nodes.
Each node contains data and a reference to the next element in the list.
There are also doubly-linked lists where each node has links to both the previous and next elements.

Question 2: What is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList in Java?

Answer: The main difference lies in how the data is internally stored.
In an ArrayList, data is stored in an array, while in a LinkedList, data is stored in nodes
that are connected to each other. This has performance implications:
inserting and deleting elements in a LinkedList is typically more efficient,
while accessing elements in an ArrayList is faster.

Question 3: How do you add an element to the beginning of a LinkedList?

Answer: To add an element to the beginning of a LinkedList, you can use the addFirst() method. For example:

java
Copy code
LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.addFirst("NewElement");

Question 4: How do you remove the last element from a LinkedList?

Answer: The last element of a LinkedList can be removed using the removeLast() method. For example:

java
Copy code
LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
// Add some elements to the list
list.removeLast();

Question 5: How do you iterate through a LinkedList in Java?

Answer: You can use a loop to iterate through a LinkedList in Java. Here's an example using a for loop:

java
Copy code
LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
// Add some elements to the list

for (String element : list) {
    System.out.println(element);
}

Question 6: How can you access a specific element in a LinkedList?

Answer: You can access a specific element in a LinkedList by using indices.
Use the get(index) method to retrieve the element at a specific index.
However, note that accessing elements in a LinkedList is slower than in an ArrayList
because the LinkedList needs to be traversed from the beginning.

java
Copy code
LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
// Add some elements to the list

String element = list.get(2); // Access the element at index 2
