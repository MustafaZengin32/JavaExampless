1.What is the difference between the pre-increment operator (++x) and the post-increment operator (x++)?

Answer: The pre-increment operator increases the value of the variable x by one and returns the incremented value,
while the post-increment operator returns the value of x first and then increments the value by one.

i++ is a post-increment, which uses the value of i first and then increments i.
++i is a pre-increment, which increments i first and then uses the incremented value

2.What is the value of x after the execution of the following code?

int x = 5;
int y = ++x + x++;

Answer: The value of x will be 7.
In ++x, x is incremented by one before adding, then x++ will return the value of x (now 6), and finally, x will be incremented again.
