Question 1: What is a "do-while" loop in programming?

Answer: A "do-while" loop is a control structure in programming that allows a specific code block to be executed repeatedly
as long as a specified condition is true.
The key difference from the "while" loop is that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.

Question 2: What is the general syntax of a "do-while" loop?

Answer: The general syntax of a "do-while" loop is as follows:

do {
    // Code block that will be executed at least once
} while (condition);

Question 3: What is the difference between a "do-while" loop and a "while" loop?

Answer: The main difference is that the code block in a "do-while" loop is executed at least once, regardless of the condition.
In a "while" loop, the code block might never be executed if the condition is false from the beginning.

Question 4: When is using a "do-while" loop appropriate?

Answer: A "do-while" loop is appropriate when you want to ensure that a specific code block is executed at least once
before checking the condition. This is useful, for example,
when processing user input and you want to ensure the code block is executed regardless of the validity of the input.

Question 5: What problem could arise if the condition in a "do-while" loop is always true?

Answer: If the condition in a "do-while" loop is always true, it could lead to an infinite loop,
where the code block keeps executing repeatedly without ever stopping.
This can cause the program to hang and have unintended consequences.
