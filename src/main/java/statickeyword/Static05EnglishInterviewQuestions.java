1. What does the "static" keyword mean in Java?

Answer: In Java, the "static" keyword is used to declare an element (variable, method, or block)
as a part of the class rather than a part of an instance (object).

2. When do you use the "static" keyword for variables?

Answer: The "static" keyword is used for class variables.
Class variables are shared variables for all instances of a class and are referenced using the class name followed by a dot.

3. When do you use the "static" keyword for methods?

Answer: The "static" keyword is used for class methods.
Class methods belong to the class itself, not an instance.
They can be called without creating an instance of the class.

4. What are the advantages of using "static" in Java?

Answer: Using "static" in Java offers several advantages:

Memory efficiency: Static variables and methods are stored in memory only once, regardless of the number of class instances.
Global accessibility: Static elements can be accessed from anywhere in the program code using the class name.
Class-level operations: Static methods can work at the class level and don't have access to instance data.

5. What is the difference between a static method and a non-static (instance) method?

Answer: The main difference is that static methods operate at the class level and have no access to instance-specific data,
while non-static methods are bound to an instance and can access instance data.
Static methods can be called directly using the class name, whereas non-static methods require an instance of the class.
