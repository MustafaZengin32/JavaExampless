Question 1: Explain the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop in Java.

Answer: A while loop first checks the condition and only executes the loop body if the condition is true.
On the other hand, a do-while loop executes the loop body at least once and then checks the condition.
This means that the loop body in the do-while loop will be executed at least once,
regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

Question 2: How do you prevent an infinite loop in a while loop?

Answer: To prevent an infinite loop, you need to ensure that the condition inside the while loop becomes false at some point.
You can use a variable that gets incremented or modified within the loop, and use that variable to check the condition.

Question 3: How do you prematurely terminate a while loop?

Answer: You can prematurely terminate a loop using the break statement.
The break statement will exit the loop and execute the code after the loop.

Question 4: How do you skip an iteration in a while loop?

Answer: You can skip an iteration using the continue statement.
The continue statement skips the remaining code in the loop body for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.

Question 5: Why is it important to ensure that the condition in a while loop eventually becomes false?

Answer: If the condition in a while loop never becomes false, it will lead to an infinite loop
