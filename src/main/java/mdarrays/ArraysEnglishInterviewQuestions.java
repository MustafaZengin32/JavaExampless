    1. What is an array in Java?

Answer: An array is a data structure in Java that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same data type.
Each element in the array is identified by an index, starting from 0.

2. How do you declare and initialize an array in Java?

Answer: Arrays can be declared and initialized in the following ways:

int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Declaration and initialization with a specified size
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Declaration and initialization with values

3. How do you access elements in an array?

Answer: You can access elements in an array using their index.
For example, to access the first element of an array arr, you would use arr[0].

4. What is the length of an array in Java?

Answer: You can obtain the length of an array using the length property.
For example, arr.length gives you the number of elements in the array.

5. How do you iterate through an array in Java?

Answer: You can use a for loop or an enhanced for loop (for-each) to iterate through an array.

6. What is an array index out of bounds exception, and how can it be prevented?

Answer: An array index out of bounds exception occurs when you try to access an element at an index that doesn't exist in the array.
To prevent it, always ensure that your index is within the valid range (0 to arr.length - 1) before accessing an element.

7. Can you change the size of an array in Java after it's created?

Answer: No, the size of an array in Java is fixed after it's created.
If you need a dynamic-sized data structure, consider using an ArrayList or another collection class.

8. What is a multi-dimensional array in Java?

Answer: A multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays. It's used to represent tables of data or matrices. For example, a 2D array can be declared like this:
java
Copy code
int[][] matrix = new int[3][3]; // 3x3 matrix
