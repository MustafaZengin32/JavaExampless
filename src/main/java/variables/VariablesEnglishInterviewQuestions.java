1.What is a Java variable?
storage location in memory and holds a value of a specific data type.

2.How do you declare a variable in Java?
specific data type and variable name,for example: int num;

3.Which data types does Java support for variables?
primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, boolean,
as well as reference data types such as classes, arrays, and interfaces.

4.What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?
Answer: A local variable is visible only within a specific code block (e.g., a method) and does not have a default value,
while an instance variable belongs to a class and is initialized with a default value.

5.What does it mean when a variable in Java is declared as "final"?
its value cannot be changed after initialization, making it a constant.

6.What is the difference between static variables and instance variables?
Answer: Static variables are declared with the "static" keyword. They exist independently of any instance of the class.
Instance variables bound to each object of the class.

7.How do you initialize a variable in Java?
during declaration, e.g.: int num = 10;
or later in the code through assignment, e.g.: num = 20;

8.What is the default value for a variable if it is not initialized?
depends on their data type (e.g., 0 for int, null for objects),
while local variables do not have a default value and must be explicitly initialized before use.

9.What is the concept of "variable scope" in Java?
where the variable is visible and accessible.

10.what is the diffrent between primitive and non primitive

Data Type Nature:
Primitive data types are basic and fundamental data types
They represent simple values.

Non-primitive data types are more complex and are composed of multiple primitive data types.
They represent objects and have methods and properties.

Memory Storage:
Primitive data types are stored directly in memory and store the actual value.
Non-primitive data types are stored as references or memory addresses that point to the actual object's location in memory.

Default Values:
Primitive data types have default values assigned to them when declared but not initialized explicitly (e.g., 0 for numbers, false for boolean, null for reference types).
Non-primitive data types (reference types) have a default value of "null" until they are explicitly initialized with an object.

Method Access:
Primitive data types do not have methods associated with them as they are not objects.
Non-primitive data types (objects) have methods and properties that can be accessed and used.

Copying and Assignment:
In Java, when you assign a primitive data type to another variable, the value is copied.
When you assign a non-primitive data type (object) to another variable, the reference is copied, not the actual object.
Both variables point to the same object in memory.

Memory Consumption:
Primitive data types generally require less memory as they directly store the values.
Non-primitive data types (objects) typically require more memory, as they store the reference to the actual object, which itself might be larger in size.

Examples of primitive data types in Java: int, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long.
Examples of non-primitive data types in Java: Classes, Arrays, Interfaces, Enums, Strings.
