Question 1: What is the Java String class?

Answer: The String class in Java is a predefined class used to represent sequences of characters (text).
It's part of the Java Standard Library and provides a variety of methods for manipulating, comparing, and working with strings.

Question 2: What is the difference between String and StringBuilder?

Answer: The main difference is that String objects are immutable,
meaning that any operation that changes their content creates a new String object.
StringBuilder objects, on the other hand, are mutable and
can be used more efficiently when performing a large number of string manipulation operations,
as they can directly modify their content without creating new objects.

Question 3: How do you compare two String objects for equality?

Answer: To compare String objects for equality, you should use the equals() method.

Question 4: What's the difference between == and equals() for String comparisons?

Answer: The == operator compares the references of the String objects for equality (whether they refer to the same object in memory),
whereas the equals() method compares the actual contents of the strings to determine if they are the same.

Question 5: How can you modify the content of a String?

Answer: Since String objects are immutable, you cannot directly modify their content. Instead, you need to create a new String object.
A common way to do this is by using the concat() method or the + operator:

Question 6: How do you extract a part of a string?

Answer: You can use the substring() method to extract a part of a string. For example:

Question 7: How do you check if a string contains a specific substring?

Answer: You can use the contains() method:

Question 8: How do you split a string based on a specific delimiter?

Answer: The split() method allows you to split a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter:

Question 9: How do you convert a string to uppercase or lowercase?

Answer: You can use the toUpperCase() method to convert to uppercase and the toLowerCase() method to convert to lowercase:
