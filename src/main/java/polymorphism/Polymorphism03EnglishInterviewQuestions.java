Question 1: What is polymorphism in Java?

Answer: Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that
allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
It enables you to write more flexible and extensible code.

Question 2: What are the two types of polymorphism in Java?

Answer: There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:

Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is also known as method overloading. It occurs at compile time and involves multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but with different parameters.

Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved through method overriding. It occurs at runtime and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with method calls being resolved at runtime based on the actual object type.
