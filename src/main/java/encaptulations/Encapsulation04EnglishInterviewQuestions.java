 What is encapsulation in Java?

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that
operate on that data into a single unit called a class.
It also involves restricting access to the internal state of an object.

Why is encapsulation important in Java?

Encapsulation improves code security and maintainability by hiding the internal details
of an object from external interference.
It also allows controlled access to an object's properties and behavior through well-defined interfaces.

Which keyword is used to declare private data fields in Java?

The private keyword is used to declare private data fields in Java.
Private fields can only be accessed within the same class and not from outside.

What are getter and setter methods in Java, and why are they used in encapsulation?

Getter methods are used to retrieve the values of private fields (data members).
Setter methods are used to modify or set the values of private fields.
They are used in encapsulation to provide controlled access to the internal state of an object,
enabling validation and encapsulation of implementation details.
