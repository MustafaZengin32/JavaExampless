Question 1: What is inheritance in Java, and why is it important?

Answer: Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where
a class (the subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and methods of another class (the base class or superclass).
It allows for code reuse and the creation of class hierarchies.
Inheritance is important because it forms the basis for establishing relationships between classes and facilitates code structuring.

Question 2: How is inheritance implemented in Java?

Answer: In Java, inheritance is implemented using the "extends" keyword.
The subclass inherits the properties and methods of the superclass.

Question 4: What is the "super" class, and how is it used in Java?

Answer: The "super" class is the base class from which a subclass inherits.
In Java, it is used with the super keyword to access properties and methods of the superclass.
This is useful when there are properties or methods with the same name in both the subclass and the superclass,
ensuring you access the ones defined in the superclass.

Question 5: What are the types of inheritance in Java?

Answer: In Java, there are two main types of inheritance:

Single Inheritance: A class inherits from a single superclass.

Question 6: What is the difference between "is-a" and "has-a" relationships in inheritance?

Answer: In the context of inheritance, the "is-a" relationship describes a relationship where
a subclass is a specialized form of the superclass.
The "has-a" relationship pertains to using another class as part of an object.
