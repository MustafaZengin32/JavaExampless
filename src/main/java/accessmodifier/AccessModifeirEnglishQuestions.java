    Question 1: What are the access modifiers in Java, and what do they mean?

Answer: In Java, there are four main access modifiers:

public: The variable or method is accessible from anywhere.
protected: The variable or method is accessible within the same class, in subclasses (inheritance), and within the same package.
Default (no modifier specified): The variable or method is only accessible within the same class and within the same package.
private: The variable or method is only accessible within the same class.

Question 3: Which access modifiers are often used in Java interfaces?

Answer: Java interfaces typically don't use access modifiers,
 as all fields are automatically declared as public, static, and final.
  Interface methods are by default public and cannot be given private or protected access.

 Question 4: What is the difference between public and default (no modifier) visibility?

Answer:

public: The variable or method is visible and accessible from anywhere.
Default (no modifier): The variable or method is only visible and accessible within the same class and within the same package.
 When no access modifier is specified, it's known as "package-private."
Question 5: What are the advantages of using private access?

Answer: Using private access protects variables and methods from direct external access, enabling data encapsulation.
This enhances security and facilitates code maintenance, as changes to the internal details of a class do not impact external code.

Question 6: Can a protected method be called outside of the package?

Answer: Yes, a protected method can be called in subclasses,
even if they are outside of the package. However, it is not accessible to other classes outside the package.
