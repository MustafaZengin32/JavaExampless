Question 1: What is a ternary operator in Java?

Answer: A ternary operator in Java is a conditional operator
that takes three operands and evaluates a boolean expression.
It returns one of two values based on the evaluation of the boolean expression.
The syntax of the ternary operator is: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false.

Question 2: Provide an example of how to use the ternary operator in Java.

Answer: Certainly! Here's an example that uses the ternary operator to determine whether a given number is even or odd:

Question 4: What happens if only one of the values returned by the ternary operator is assigned to a variable of a certain type?

Answer: The value that is assigned to the variable must be compatible with the variable's type.
If the two values have different types, the Java compiler will attempt to perform implicit type conversion if possible.
If the types are not compatible, a compilation error will occur.

Question 5: Can ternary operators be nested?

Answer: Yes, ternary operators can be nested.
This allows for more complex conditional expressions.
However, nesting them excessively can lead to code that is difficult to read and understand.

Question 6: What are some advantages of using the ternary operator?

Answer: The ternary operator can make code more concise and reduce the need for explicit if-else statements in some cases.
It can also improve code readability when used appropriately for simple conditions.

Question 7: What are some limitations or considerations when using the ternary operator?

Answer: Complex conditions or multiple actions within the ternary operator can make the code harder to understand.
In such cases, it's better to use traditional if-else statements for clarity.
