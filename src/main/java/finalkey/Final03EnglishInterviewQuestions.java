Question 1: What does the "final" keyword mean for a variable in Java?

Answer: In Java, the "final" keyword for a variable means that
the variable cannot be changed (i.e., it becomes constant) after it is initialized.
It must be assigned a value either at the time of declaration or in the constructor.

Question 2: When should you use the "final" keyword for a variable?

Answer: You should use the "final" keyword for a variable when you want to indicate that
its value should not be modified after initialization.
It's typically used for constants or parameters that should not be overridden.

Question 3: Can a "final" variable be assigned a value later?

Answer: Yes, a "final" variable can be assigned a value later,
but only in the constructor or an initialization block. Once assigned, its value cannot be changed again.

Question 4: What does the "final" keyword mean for a method in Java?

Answer: The "final" keyword for a method in Java means that the method cannot be overridden (i.e., changed) by subclasses.
It makes the method unmodifiable in derived classes.

Question 5: Why would you use the "final" keyword for a method?

Answer: You would use the "final" keyword for a method to ensure that the method's behavior remains consistent across subclasses.
This can be important for maintaining desired functionality and avoiding potential errors or security vulnerabilities.

Question 6: Can an abstract method be declared as "final"?

Answer: No, an abstract method cannot be declared as "final."
The combination of "abstract" and "final" is contradictory
because an abstract method must be overridden by subclasses.

Question 7: What does the "final" keyword mean for a class in Java?

Answer: The "final" keyword for a class in Java means that the class cannot be extended or subclassed.
It becomes an immutable, final class.

Question 9: Can an abstract class be declared as "final"?

Answer: Yes, an abstract class can be declared as "final." This means that no other class can extend the final abstract class.
However, it's important to note that a "final" abstract class cannot have any abstract methods.
