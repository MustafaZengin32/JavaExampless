1. What is a Set in Java?

A Set is an interface in Java that is part of the Java Collections Framework.
It is used to store a collection of elements, but unlike a List, it does not allow duplicate elements.
2. What are the main implementations of the Set interface in Java?

The primary implementations of the Set interface in Java are:
HashSet: It uses a hash table for storage and does not guarantee the order of elements.
LinkedHashSet: It maintains the order of elements as they were added.
TreeSet: It stores elements in a sorted (natural order or with a custom Comparator) manner.
3. How do you ensure that a Set does not allow duplicate elements?

The Set interface inherently does not allow duplicate elements.
It relies on the hashCode and equals methods to ensure uniqueness.

4. What is the difference between HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet?

HashSet uses a hash table for storage and does not guarantee the order of elements.
LinkedHashSet maintains the order of elements as they were added.
TreeSet stores elements in a sorted manner (natural order or custom order based on a Comparator).
5. How do you iterate through elements in a Set?

You can use an iterator or the enhanced for loop (for-each loop) to iterate through the elements in a Set.

6. What is the difference between add() and addAll() methods for adding elements to a Set?

The add() method is used to add a single element to a Set.
The addAll() method is used to add all elements from another collection to a Set.

7. How do you check if a particular element exists in a Set?

You can use the contains(Object obj) method to check if a specific element exists in a Set.

8. Can a null value be added to a Set?

Yes, most Set implementations in Java allow a null value to be added.

9. Explain the use of the Set interface in Java applications.

The Set interface is commonly used in situations where you need to store a collection of unique elements,
such as maintaining a list of unique items, removing duplicates from a collection, or checking for the existence of items.

10. What is the difference between a Set and a List?
- A Set does not allow duplicate elements and does not guarantee any specific order,
 while a List allows duplicate elements and maintains the order in which elements were added.
